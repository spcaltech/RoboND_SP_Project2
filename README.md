Udacity - Robotics Software Engineering Project 2 :: Go Chase It [Ball Chasing Robot in a World]
Overview:

1. Create a world with a building structures (walls and doors for the robot to move around)
2. Create a robot with a camera and a LIDAR
3. Create white balls in the world for the robot to identify and chase
4. Create the required algorithms to process the camera image and drive the robot to the appropriate position
